# Ising_field
A two dimensional Ising model simulation on a square lattice, looking at effects of field throughout on pattern and order


The Ising2d.py script includes a Lattice object that creates a rectangular lattice of spin sites of a specified size,
temperature and magnetic field through the lattice. One must create a lattice object and test it in the main declaration
at the bottom or in IDLE to test lattices. The fields are declared at the top, and there is function descriptor in the
current main to show how custom functions can be made.
